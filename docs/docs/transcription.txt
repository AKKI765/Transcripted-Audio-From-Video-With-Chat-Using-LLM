I want to wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving. Today, as we gather with our loved ones, we give thanks to almighty God for his many blessings, including our families, our friends, our neighbors, and this extraordinary country that we all call home. We also send our deep gratitude to all of the patriots serving our nation in uniform this Thanksgiving, including the members of the US. Armed forces, the heroes of border patrol and law enforcement and ice, and everybody that worked so hard to preserve our system and our country and working to defend our southern border and our police and first responders and communities all across America. This is a difficult time for our country, but do not lose heart or lose hope, because by the time we celebrate next Thanksgiving, our nation will be well on its way to being stronger, safer, more prosperous and greater than ever before. Once again, happy Thanksgiving and God bless you all.
